The file "annotations.xlsx" includes the annotations of the white papers.

Currently it includes four annotations: Token utility; Usage of the tokens; Scale of Technical writing; Scale of Technical writing; application fields of ICOs.

General explantion of the annotations are showed in the below, for detailed information, please refer to the paper "ICOWD: An ICO Database with Quality-Controlled Annotations".
Token utility: Token utility represents the closeness between the token with the project. If the relation between project and token is closer, it is marked with higher score.

Scale of technical writing: There are three scales of technical writing. A white paper will be marked 0 if there is essentially no technical writing. A white paper will be marked 1 if there is only limited technical writing. A white paper will be marked 2 if there is professional technical writing.

Usage of the tokens: We divide the token usage into four categories: platform token, payment token, security token, and utility token. In the file, 0: platform token, 1: payment token, 2: security token, 3: utility token.

Application fields of ICOs: The applications of ICOs are also divided into four categories including authentication, ﬁnance, value exchange and information service. In the file, 1: authentication, 2: ﬁnance, 3:value exchange, 4: information service.


In the file, the tag "Technicality" represents the scale of technical writing; the tag "Usage" represents Usage of the tokens; the tag "Application" represents application fields of ICOs.
